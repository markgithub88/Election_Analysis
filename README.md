Deliverable 3: Written Analysis of the Election Audit (20 points)
Deliverable 3 Instructions

**Overview of Election Audit**: Explain the purpose of this election audit analysis. This analysis is necessary because each election needs an outcome count.  We need to know the winners and vote counts and the counties from which they came!

**Election-Audit Results**: Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary.

How many votes were cast in this congressional election? Total Votes: 369,711  
Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
- Jefferson: 10.5% (38,855)
- Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
- Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)

Which county had the largest number of votes? Denver

Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
- Charles Casper Stockham: 23.0% (85,213)
- Diana DeGette: 73.8% (272,892)
- Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.1% (11,606)
- 
Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?
- Diana DeGette with 272,892 votes, 
- which is 73.8%

**Election-Audit Summary:** In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.

SUMMARY
The election analysis shows that there were 369,711 votes cast in this election.  Stockham recieved 23% of the vote, Doane, 3.1%, and DeGette 73.8% (272,892). (I hope in the future, Mr Stockham will overcome Ms. DeGette personally.  It's time for a change)
This code could be logically run for ANY election data anywhere.  
1) Modify the Ballot ID,County,Candidate to match your particular country's voting structure.
2) Modify the code so that your outcome file shows the data that's important to you.  For example, if you needed to see more data related to the winner, then move that code to the top, or any other style that you need.
